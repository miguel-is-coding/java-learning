## Pangram Detector

A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence _"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"_ is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.
