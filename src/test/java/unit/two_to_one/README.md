## Two to one

Take 2 strings including only letters from `a` to `z`. Return a new sorted string, the longest possible, containing distinct letters - each taken only once - coming from the 2 strings.

**Examples**
```
a = "xyaabbbccccdefww"
b = "xxxxyyyyabklmopq"
longest(a, b) -> "abcdefklmopqwxy"

a = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
longest(a, a) -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
```
